# Hobby-web

This project is a small informational site designed to help new Linux users choose a beginner-friendly distribution and understand the basics of personalising their system.

## Scope
- Provide an accessible introduction to Linux and explain key terminology in plain language.
- Highlight several beginner-focused distributions with quick summaries and official links.
- Offer additional resources through the `Help me` page and a personalisation guide for next steps after installation.

## Functionality
- Fully static site built with HTML and Tailwind CSS delivered via CDN.
- Navigation bar links the core pages: `index.html`, `distros.html`, `personalisation.html`, and `help.html`.
- Each page focuses on a specific part of the learning journey so newcomers can explore topics at their own pace.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in any modern browser to explore the guide. No build tooling or dependencies required.
